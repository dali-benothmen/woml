# WOML CLI

The WOML CLI compiles a `.woml` workflow, executes its DAG through the Rust
core, runs embedded JavaScript in isolated Bun Workers, and prints the final
JSON result.

## Run a workflow

From a built or linked checkout:

```bash
woml run examples/retryWorkflow.woml
```

To choose the durable state database explicitly:

```bash
woml run examples/retryWorkflow.woml --state .woml/state.sqlite
```

Retry progress is printed to stderr. The final workflow result is the only JSON
written to stdout, so it can be redirected or piped without mixing in logs.

## Retry a step

Retry is configured on `<step>`; there is no retry tag:

```xml
<step
  id="fetchData"
  retry="3"
  retry-backoff="exponential"
  retry-delay="1s"
  retry-max-delay="30s">
  <script>
    return await fetchData(attempt.idempotencyKey);
  </script>
</step>
```

`retry="3"` means at most three total attempts. Only a definitive
`script_threw` failure retries in the first profile. Timeouts, invalid results,
size-limit failures, host or Worker crashes, cancellation, and interrupted
attempts fail closed.

Every attempt receives:

- `attempt.number`: the current one-based attempt number.
- `attempt.maxAttempts`: the configured maximum.
- `attempt.idempotencyKey`: one stable key shared by all attempts of this step
  in this run.

Pass that key to external services that support idempotency. WOML cannot make an
arbitrary JavaScript side effect exactly once by itself.

## Resume a safely scheduled retry

After the engine durably schedules the first retry, the CLI prints a recovery
command. If the CLI stops while waiting, run that exact command:

```bash
woml run "examples/retryWorkflow.woml" \
  --state ".woml/state.sqlite" \
  --resume "run_..."
```

Completed attempts and steps are not replayed. An attempt that started but has
no recorded outcome is ambiguous and fails as `interrupted` instead of running
again.

## Local development

```bash
cd woml-cli
bun install
bun run build
bun run test:ri7
```

The RI7 gate builds the distributable CLI/native core and verifies the
frontend, Rust engine, Bun host, CLI, contracts, compatibility, clean-package
execution, linting, type checking, and secret-leak protections.
